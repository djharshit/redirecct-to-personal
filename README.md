# Website Redirect

This repository hosts a simple HTML page that redirects visitors. It's primarily used for redirecting traffic from one URL (configured via DNS to point to this GitHub Pages site) to the specified target URL.

## Overview

The purpose of this project is to provide a straightforward method for redirecting web traffic from one domain to another without the need for server-side configuration changes. This is particularly useful when you're limited by hosting capabilities or prefer to use GitHub Pages for hosting static files.

## How It Works

The redirection is achieved through a simple HTML meta tag in the `index.html` file at the root of this repository. When visitors access the site hosted by GitHub Pages for this repo, the HTML page immediately redirects them to the specified target URL using the meta refresh technique.

## Viewing the Redirect

To see the redirect in action, visit the URL.
